# alx-files_manager

## background context
* This project is a summary of the back-end specialization trimester: authentication, NodeJS, MongoDB, Redis, pagination and background processing.
* It brings together several key concepts that are essential for building scalable web applications, such as:

User authentication (with tokens)
File management (listing, uploading, and viewing files)
Access control (changing file permissions)
Image processing (generating thumbnails)
Pagination for efficient data navigation
Background processing for handling tasks asynchronously
The objective is to build a file management platform with a structured approach, encouraging you to assemble each piece while having the flexibility to organize your implementation (e.g., using an utils/ folder).

Although similar services exist in the real world, this project provides a hands-on experience to integrate these technologies and develop a working solution.
